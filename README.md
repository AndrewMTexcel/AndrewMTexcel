- 👋 Hi, I’m @AndrewMTexcel
      I have been working at Texcel since the early 90s, and have written 1000s of lines of code, mostly in VS - from VB3 to VS2019
- 👀 I’m interested in using this as a means to let those who take over from me have easy access to that code
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C# and Python
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate
- 📫 How to reach me ... www.texcel.com.au
